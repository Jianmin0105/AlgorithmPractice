/****
The power of an integer x is defined as the number of steps needed to transform x into 1 using the following steps:

if x is even then x = x / 2
if x is odd then x = 3 * x + 1
For example, the power of x = 3 is 7 because 3 needs 7 steps to become 1 (3 --> 10 --> 5 --> 16 --> 8 --> 4 --> 2 --> 1).

Given three integers lo, hi and k. The task is to sort all integers in the interval [lo, hi] by the power value in ascending order, if two or more integers have the same power value sort them by ascending order.

Return the k-th integer in the range [lo, hi] sorted by the power value.

Notice that for any integer x (lo <= x <= hi) it is guaranteed that x will transform into 1 using these steps and that the power of x is will fit in 32 bit signed integer.

            @Override
            public int compare(Integer one, Integer two) {
                if (power(one) == power(two)) {

                }
                return power(two) < power(one) ? -1 : 1;
            }
        });
        for (int i = lo; i <= hi; i++) {

                val = val / 2;

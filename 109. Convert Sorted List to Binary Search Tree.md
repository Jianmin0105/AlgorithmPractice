Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example:
```

Given the sorted linked list: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
 
 ```
 
 ```java
 class Solution {
    private ListNode head;
    public TreeNode sortedListToBST(ListNode head) {
        this.head = head;
        ListNode pointer = head;
        int count = 0;
        while (pointer != null) {
            count++;
            pointer = pointer.next;
        }
        return helper(0, count - 1);
    }
    private TreeNode helper(int left, int right) {
        if (left > right) {
            return null;
        }
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        TreeNode leftNode = helper(left, mid - 1);
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(head.val);
        root.left = leftNode;
        head = head.next;
        root.right = helper(mid + 1, right);
        return root;
    }    
}

```

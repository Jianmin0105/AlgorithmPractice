You have some apples, where arr[i] is the weight of the i-th apple.  You also have a basket that can carry up to 5000 units of weight.

Return the maximum number of apples you can put in the basket.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: arr = [100,200,150,1000]
Output: 4
Explanation: All 4 apples can be carried by the basket since their sum of weights is 1450.
```
## put less weight apple as many as possible

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxNumberOfApples(int[] arr) {
        if (arr == null || arr.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int i = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            sum += arr[i];
            if (sum > 5000) {
                break;
            } 
            
        }
        return i;
    }
}

```
